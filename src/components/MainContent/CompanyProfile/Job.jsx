        "OCR, or Optical Character Recognition, is a technology that enables the conversion of various types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDF files, or images captured by a camera, into editable and searchable data. By analyzing the visual patterns of characters and symbols in the input document, OCR software identifies and interprets the text, enabling users to extract, edit, and manipulate the content digitally. This technology finds applications across a wide range of industries, including finance, healthcare, legal, and education, where digitizing and processing large volumes of text-based information is essential for efficiency and productivity. OCR systems have evolved to provide high accuracy levels, even with complex fonts, languages, and formatting structures, contributing significantly to streamlining document management processes and facilitating accessibility for individuals with visual impairments.",
